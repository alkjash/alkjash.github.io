I co-organize the Georgia Tech Combinatorics Seminar with [Tom Kelly](https://tomkelly.math.gatech.edu/) and [Jiaxi Nie](https://jiaxinie.github.io/). Please reach out to one of us if you would like to give a talk or be added to the mailing list.

Please find [here](https://sites.gatech.edu/combinatorics/events) a partial list of the many other regular events of interest to combinatorialists at Georgia Tech.
