Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Math at Georgia Tech.

In Spring 2024, I will teach [Math 7018](https://math.gatech.edu/courses/math/7018) (Probabilistic Methods in Combinatorics). In Fall 2024, I taught [Math 4022](https://math.gatech.edu/courses/math/4022) (Introduction to Graph Theory). 

My  research interests are extremal, probabilistic, and algebraic combinatorics, especially Ramsey theory, graph coloring, additive combinatorics, discrete geometry, and coding theory, and their applications to computer science.

Previously, I was an NSF postdoctoral research fellow at Princeton University working with [Noga Alon](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~nalon/). Before that, I received my PhD in mathematics from Stanford University in 2021, where my advisor was [Jacob Fox](https://stanford.edu/~jacobfox/).

You can find my CV [here](https://alkjash.github.io/files/CV_Xiaoyu_He.pdf). I blog about life, research, and rationality at [my personal blog](https://radimentary.wordpress.com); most of my better posts can also be found cross-posted on [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/alkjash).

#### My group

[Jiaxi Nie](https://jiaxinie.github.io/) (Visiting Assistant Professor)
[Ruben Ascoli](https://sites.google.com/view/ruben-ascoli) (ACO PhD Student)

If you are a student interested in working with me, please reach out after taking a look at [problems](https://alkjash.github.io/problems/) and [my blog](https://alkjash.github.io/blog/) to get a sense of my research interests and philosophy.
