I am a NSF postdoctoral research fellow in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University.

My  research interests are extremal, probabilistic, and algebraic combinatorics, especially Ramsey theory, graph coloring, additive combinatorics, discrete geometry, and the combinatorics of words, with applications to computer science.

I received my PhD in mathematics from Stanford University in 2021, where my advisor was [Jacob Fox](https://stanford.edu/~jacobfox/).

You can find my CV [here](alkjash.github.io/files/HeXCV.pdf). I blog about life, research, and rationality at [my personal blog](radimentary.wordpress.com); most of my better posts can be found cross-posted on [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/alkjash).
