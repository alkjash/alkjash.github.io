I am a NSF postdoctoral research fellow in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University.

In Spring 2023, I am teaching MAT 378: Theory of Games. I taught [MAT 104: Calculus II](https://www.math.princeton.edu/undergraduate/placement/MAT104) in Fall 2022.

See [here](/seminar/) for information on the Princeton combinatorics learning seminar.

My  research interests are extremal, probabilistic, and algebraic combinatorics, especially Ramsey theory, graph coloring, additive combinatorics, discrete geometry, and coding theory, with applications to computer science.

I received my PhD in mathematics from Stanford University in 2021, where my advisor was [Jacob Fox](https://stanford.edu/~jacobfox/).

You can find my CV [here](https://alkjash.github.io/files/CV_Xiaoyu_He.pdf). I blog about life, research, and rationality at [my personal blog](https://radimentary.wordpress.com); most of my better posts can also be found cross-posted on [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/alkjash).
