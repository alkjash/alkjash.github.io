Here are a few of my favorite open problems (that are not already well-known).

1. The (oriented) Ramsey number $r(H)$ of an (acyclic) directed graph $H$ is the smallest $N$ such that every tournament on $N$ vertices contains a copy of $H$.
Is $r(H)$ always bounded by a polynomial in the number of vertices of $H$ if $H$ has bounded degree?
